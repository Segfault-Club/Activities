# The Art of Bad Code
Dated: Sept 11, 2025

We often discuss how to write good code, but what about bad code?
This time, the goal is to create the most unreadable yet functional one-liner.


## Rules

1. You cannot use tricks like `echo 'my code' >code.py && python code.py`.
2. You are allowed up to 3 lines of setup for imports or similar preparations.
3. The main command must be a one-liner, and no additional setup is allowed.


## Submissions

Submit your code in the club's chat.
Wrap your code in triple backticks ("```") and enable syntax highlighting.
Include a description of what your code does and how it works.


## Winners

There are no official winners for this challenge.
However, all final submissions will be uploaded to the repository,
and everyone is encouraged to discuss which one-liner is the best.
