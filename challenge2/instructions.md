# Challenge 2 is out!

Often times, we see ourselves discussing how to make good code, but how do we
make bad code? On this challenger, the winner will be the one that makes the
most unreadable yet usefull oneliner, the rules are as follow:

### Rules

1. The language in question must be a scripting language (python, bash, etc)
2. You may not do something like `echo 'my code' >code.py && python code.py`
3. You may have at most 3 lines of set-up, this are for imports and things of the kind
4. The command to run it may also be a oneliner, but no setupt is allowed


## How to submit?

To submit your code, simply send it in the club's chat. Make sure to enclose the
code in triple backticks ("`") and to enable syntax highlighting. Make sure to
add a description of what does your code do and how does it do it.


## Winners

This challenge doesn't have a winner, but all final attempts should be uploaded
to the repo, and everyone is welcome to discuss about which oneliner was the best
